# Advanced Smart Home Assistant

## Project Description
This project implements an advanced, rule-based Smart Home Assistant in Python. It allows users to control smart home devices such as lights, temperature, and security systems via text commands. The assistant supports multiple rooms, maintains device states across sessions using JSON context files, and provides helpful feedback and command guidance.

The assistant runs in a command-line interface, enabling interaction without complex GUIs or external hardware. It demonstrates core concepts of home automation, state management, and simple natural language processing using regular expressions.
